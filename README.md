This assignment is to create a business site using HTML and CSS, should contain various pages, menu and some other common features for a basic business site.

## The problem

I started off by doing a basic sketch on paper and then built the page.
This business already had a logo with color scheme and font which I used as a base for the design of the page. 
I used a mobile-first approach building the site and a structure based on answers I got from the owners about the consumer behaviour.
